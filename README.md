# Introduction

App Upgrade acts as a **Upgrade-Wall**. It is a service to effectively force users to upgrade your mobile app or let them know that there is new and improved version is available.

When you publish your app's new version to the playstore or the app store. User may get the updates automatically and app will be updated in the background if the auto app update setting is on in users mobile.
This is the best case scenario for you.
In practicality users may not get the app updates as soon as you publish your new app version. You might want to nudge your users to let them know that there is a new app version availabel and guide them to update to latest version.
In times you might need to force users to upgrade the app because of some security fixes, breaking API changes to name a few. You want users to install the new version as soon as possible.

App Upgrade aims to solve this problem with simple and intuitive workflow. You can use available SDKs, integrate in mintues with your app and your are done. Alternatively you can choose to integrate with the API to achieve the same.
More on this on later chapters.
